    Remark for given start and/or end nodes:
        If the rotation does not match, but the tangent vector is the same,
        the created beams triads are rotated so the physical problem stays
        the same (for axi-symmetric beam cross-sections) but the nodes can
        be reused.

    Args
    ----
    mesh: Mesh
        Mesh that the created beam(s) should be added to.
    beam_object: Beam
        Class of beam that will be used for this line.
    material: Material
        Material for this line.
    function_generator: function that returns function
        The function_generator has to take two variables, point_a and
        point_b (both within the interval) and return a function(xi) that
        calculates the position and rotation along the beam, where
        point_a -> xi = -1 and point_b -> xi = 1.
    interval: [start end]
        Start and end values for interval that will be used to create the
        beam.
    n_el: int
        Number of equally spaced beam elements along the line. Defaults to 1.
        Mutually exclusive with l_el
    l_el: float
        Desired length of beam elements. This requires the option interval_length
        to be set. Mutually exclusive with n_el. Be aware, that this length
        might not be achieved, if the elements are warped after they are
        created.
    interval_length:
        Total length of the interval. Is required when the option l_el is given.
    node_positions_of_elements: [double]
        A list of normalized positions (within [0,1] and in ascending order)
        that define the boundaries of beam elements along the created curve.
        The given values will be mapped to the actual `interval` given as an
        argument to this function. These values specify where elements start
        and end, additional internal nodes (such as midpoints in higher-order
        elements) may be placed automatically.
    add_sets: bool
        If this is true the sets are added to the mesh and then displayed
        in eventual VTK output, even if they are not used for a boundary
        condition or coupling.
    start_node: Node, GeometrySet
        Node to use as the first node for this line. Use this if the line
        is connected to other lines (angles have to be the same, otherwise
        connections should be used). If a geometry set is given, it can
        contain one, and one node only.
    end_node: Node, GeometrySet, bool
        If this is a Node or GeometrySet, the last node of the created beam
        is set to that node.
        If it is True the created beam is closed within itself.
    vtk_cell_data: {cell_data_name (str): cell_data_value (float)}
        With this argument, a vtk cell data can be set for the elements
        created within this function. This can be used to check which
        elements are created by which function.

    Return
    ----
    return_set: GeometryName
        Set with the 'start' and 'end' node of the curve. Also a 'line' set
        with all nodes of the curve.
